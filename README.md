Tip Calculator
Created a Tip Calculator web app utilizing NextJS and Tailwind CSS by following a prototype. The goal is to allow the user to enter a bill total, a tip percentage, and a number of people to divide the total between. The calculator will perform arithmetic functions based upon the values entered by the user to calculate the total per person.

Peer review comments: Looks excalty like the desktop and monbile design. The functions work as intended. However, doesn't have the error message nor error outline for when the number of people are zero, and tip buttons don't keep their colors when clicked on. The bill amount and people amount input do have the outline hover effect but it streches the background. There a few small bugs, when the amount of people is zero, the tip amout/peron and the total/person displays infinity, and the zero inside the input field becomes centered. Overall, great work and nice layout styling.
