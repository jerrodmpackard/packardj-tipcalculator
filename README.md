Tip Calculator
Created a Tip Calculator web app utilizing NextJS and Tailwind CSS by following a prototype. The goal is to allow the user to enter a bill total, a tip percentage, and a number of people to divide the total between. The calculator will perform arithmetic functions based upon the values entered by the user to calculate the total per person.
